Infinite depth of monads with variable connections(functors) between them at any depth.

Use mouse wheel to change the depth.

Click any object/connection to select it.
If you're selecting an object currently hovering **over** the current depth, right clicking will add objects to it.
If you're selecting an object currently **at** the current depth, right clicking another object at the same depth will create a one-way connection travelling **to** the right-clicked object.
It will instead create a one way connection **from** the right-clicked object if it is in a different category (container object).

Key 'B' to delete all connections from and to a selected object. 
Key 'Delete' to delete a selected object and recursively delete all objects contained within that object (and so on) and their connections from and to.
